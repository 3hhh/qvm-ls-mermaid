# qvm-ls-mermaid

Generate a [mermaid-js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) network graph for your [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) system and display it inside a [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) VM.

The output is a full html page displayed in your browser. For static images you can convert that with e.g. [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli).

An example output for a default Qubes OS installation (filtered to show the network VMs only):

## Installation

1. Download [blib](https://github.com/3hhh/blib), copy it to dom0 and install it according to [its instructions](https://github.com/3hhh/blib#installation).
2. Download this repository with `git clone https://github.com/3hhh/qidle.git` or your browser and copy it to dom0.
3. Move the repository to a directory of your liking.
4. Symlink the `qvm-ls-mermaid` binary into your dom0 `PATH` for convenience, e.g. to `/usr/bin/`.

### A word of caution

It is recommended to apply standard operational security practices during installation such as:

- Github SSL certificate checks
- Check the GPG commit signatures using `git log --pretty="format:%h %G? %GK %aN  %s"`. All of them should be good (G) signatures coming from the same key `(1533 C122 5C1B 41AF C46B 33EB) EB03 A691 DB2F 0833` (assuming you trust that key).
- Code review

You're installing something to dom0 after all.

## Usage

Execute `qvm-ls-mermaid help` on the command-line to obtain an overview of its capabilities.

## Uninstall

1. Remove all symlinks that you created during the installation.
2. Remove the repository clone from dom0.
3. Uninstall [blib](https://github.com/3hhh/blib) according to [its instructions](https://github.com/3hhh/blib#uninstall).
